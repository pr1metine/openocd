This directory containts the source code of the helper binary used by
f0xx OpenOCD driver for TMSxxx series of MCUs(TMS570, TMS470, etc.).

In order to compile that file you'd need to install TI's proprietary
flashing library, which can be found at:

http://www.ti.com/tool/f021flashapi

To build it issue:

make FAPI_PATH=<path to where you installed TI's FAPI library>
